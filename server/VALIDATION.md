# Exploration release validation — 2.12.0-explore.1

Validated September 27, 2026 against the `2.12.0-explore.1` Fabric JAR and pinned bundled dependencies. The build and automated worlds are separate from the owner's live world.

## Results

- **155 native Minecraft GameTests passed**, including the framework baseline. They cover Infinity gear, crossplay mappings, community commands, separate inventories and modes, lobbies, ranks, achievement rewards, item trades, helpers, backpacks, two-party player trading, Creative tools, physical minigames, place-specific `/guide` instructions, persisted personal bests, and the public minigame leaderboard.
- **76 Python launcher tests passed.** They cover downloads and checksums, private dashboard control, owner settings, backups, Pinggy tunnel status and first-use installer safety, command handling, and runtime behavior.
- **Geyser mapping and localhost Bedrock UDP checks passed.** The generated resource pack has the referenced custom item and block textures. The bridge shut down cleanly.
- **Two isolated full-stack starts passed** with Fabric and Geyser, including all mode dimensions, Bedrock UDP response, restart, stopped-world backup, and clean shutdown. This check used the owner's already accepted EULA; it did not accept an agreement.

`tools/package_crossplay.py` checks the exact native and Python test counts, report freshness, smoke-test markers, bundled SHA-256 values, and ZIP integrity before making the release. It packages explicit files only. Worlds, backups, account data, owner settings, private keys, local panel tokens, EULA acceptance, and downloaded runtimes are excluded.

## Remaining play tests

An earlier 2.9.0 server recorded an authenticated Bedrock login on this Mac. That does **not** establish authenticated iPad play for this release. Two-player Java and Bedrock login, touch controls, wardrobe rendering, backpack and trading menus, new block textures, helper behavior, flight input, and performance with a large public player count still need device testing. A Bedrock UDP response only verifies the network listener.

Free Pinggy addresses are temporary and allocated separately for Java and Bedrock. Their presence in the local panel does not prove that an outside-network player can join. Test both editions from another network before inviting friends.

## Reproduce

Use Java 21, Python 3.9+, and the checksum-pinned dependencies described in the source guide:

```sh
python3 tools/check_crossplay.py --java /path/to/java
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_*.py' -v > research/launcher-tests.log 2>&1
python3 tools/smoke_geyser.py --java /path/to/java > research/geyser-smoke.log 2>&1
python3 tools/smoke_fullstack.py --java /path/to/java > research/fullstack-smoke.log 2>&1
python3 tools/package_crossplay.py
```
