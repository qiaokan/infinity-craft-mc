# Infinity Craft MC

Infinity Armor for one shared Minecraft Java + Bedrock world. The Java Fabric server runs the game; Geyser and Floodgate let Bedrock players join it. The public guide and downloads are at [Infinity Armor Hub](https://infinity-armor-hub.vercel.app/).

## Join Infinity Craft

| Edition | Server address | Port |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Java 26.3 | `infinity-craft.remotewire.net:25565` | Included in address |
| Bedrock / iPad | `infinity-craft.remotewire.net` | `19132` |

See [JOIN.md](JOIN.md) for connection steps. The owner confirmed a successful iPad/Bedrock join, and the Java TCP port passed an external check. A full Java player join still needs verification. You only need Minecraft on the device you play on. The host Mac must be awake and the Minecraft server running; the public website provides the guide and downloads.

## Host your own world

1. Download the **server ZIP** from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/qiaokan/infinity-craft-mc/releases) or the website and extract it to a folder you will keep. Choose the newest exploration preview if you want the new minigames and menus. The source folders in this repository are for development; they are not a ready-to-run server on their own.
2. On Mac, open `Start-Mac.command` in the extracted folder. On Windows 10/11, run `start.bat`; on Linux, run `bash start.sh`.
3. The local browser panel guides you through agreeing to the [Minecraft EULA](https://www.minecraft.net/eula), starting the world, and copying the current join addresses. The first launch downloads checksum-pinned Python/Java components and needs an Internet connection. You do not need Minecraft installed on the host computer.

Java players use **Minecraft Java 26.3** and the Java address and port shown in the panel. Bedrock players, including iPad players, use **Add Server** with the separate Bedrock address and port shown there. Accept the offered server resource pack. Players on the same local network can use the host's LAN address. For friends outside your network, follow [`server/PINGGY_JOINING.md`](server/PINGGY_JOINING.md) for temporary, sign-in-free addresses on an Apple Silicon Mac, [`server/DYNU_JOINING.md`](server/DYNU_JOINING.md) for a fixed hostname with router forwarding, or [`server/HOSTING.md`](server/HOSTING.md) for other hosting options. Free Pinggy tunnel addresses are temporary. A fixed DNS hostname requires its own setup. The host Mac must remain on and the server launcher must stay open while people play.

The local owner panel controls the server; it is not a public website. Back up a stopped world before upgrading, and keep your world, `fabric/config`, and `settings.json` private. See [`server/README.md`](server/README.md) for full setup and upgrade instructions.

The explore.14 preview adds direct health/absorption entry with automatic capacity increases in the same confirmation, reload-safe remaining absorption, native protection for expanded armor, literal gear names, complete Bedrock wearable assets and real gear directly in empty inventory slots. **Infinity Menu → Ranks & subscriptions** separates earned ranks from Admin/OP roles. Helpers use player avatars that show their equipped weapons and elytra, while retaining golem-based server AI and physical collision. Both AI approvals remain required. Native physics, client display and numeric-storage constraints remain. The earlier cross-world helper recovery and saved-lobby joining repair are included.

The **2.13.0-explore.18** update moves the server to **Minecraft Java 26.3** on Java 25. Java players need a 26.3 client; Bedrock and iPad players keep joining through Geyser, which supports Bedrock 26.30–26.52. Back up a stopped world first: Minecraft converts the world when 26.3 first loads it, and older versions cannot open it again. It also includes the explore.16 compact health display and the explore.17 knockback and collision bounds.

The **explore.15** appearance update gives every helper a shared silver-faced robot skin with cyan accents and pixel versions of the ChatGPT knot and blue-purple Codex cloud on the chest. Signed Minecraft texture data works through the native player profiles used by Java and Geyser. Your saved helpers, stats, owners and orders stay intact. Reconnect to refresh the skin; an equipped chestplate can cover the emblems. These are community skins, not official OpenAI avatars.

## Explore the world

The Main Hub leads to Survival, Creative, Hardcore, Minigames, and Adventure. Select the **Infinity Menu** compass to choose modes and use gear, powers, cosmetics, backpacks and helpers. Lobby signs open it too. `/menu`, `/guide`, `/play` and `/hub` remain optional shortcuts. The hub and five mode lobbies have themed arches, glass lighting, flags and planted corners; existing builds are preserved during the upgrade. The Minigames and Adventure hall signs open course menus; `/play minigames` and `/play adventure` open them too. Six timed minigames have `/best` and `/leaderboard <map>` commands; two starter adventure maps are included. Inventories are separated between modes.

Infinity gear includes custom blocks and building tools, armor looks, and backpacks with personal storage. `/ptrade <player>` opens a trade that both players review and confirm. Free, Go, Plus, Pro, and Ultra are earned through achievements or Survival item trades; Admin is owner-controlled. Powers and cosmetics can be earned separately. Optional supporter subscriptions are **planned at $50–$200 USD per month**, but checkout is not open. The earned ranks remain free and permanent. Read [`server/SUBSCRIPTIONS.md`](server/SUBSCRIPTIONS.md) for prices and status, and [`server/MODES.md`](server/MODES.md), [`server/EXPANSION.md`](server/EXPANSION.md), and [`server/REWARDS.md`](server/REWARDS.md) for play and unlocks.

The Infinity Menu exposes every `/convergence` feature through chest-style controls, including the gear catalogue, tool activation, powers and kits. Selecting the compass restores your previous held item so menu actions can use the weapon or tool. Permission checks still apply to ordinary players; Creative and OP4 players can equip Infinity gear. The menu uses vanilla icons on Java and Bedrock and preserves full inventories. Commands remain available as optional shortcuts. Native inventory tests pass; this update still needs a live Java and iPad UI playtest.

Admin is a free, private full-OP4 role. It grants Minecraft's highest operator level, gameplay unlock overrides and no Infinity ability cooldowns. Existing Admin roles migrate on join; revoking the role restores the previous OP level only when the role owns that promotion. An independently granted OP4 remains. Keep the private code with trusted administrators. This does not remove host/account capacity limits or the two AI reviews.

Admin/OP4 can choose **Infinity Menu → Admin editor • players and AI** to edit online players and loaded AI helpers. Review and confirm health, damage, speed, armor, size and other supported base attributes; player hunger and XP are included. Equipment and potion modifiers remain active, saved original bases can be restored, and changing or dismissing the target cancels a stale review. Two health points equal one heart; health zero kills the selected target. Minecraft numeric ranges and both AI execution approvals still apply.

Enter **Current health** or **Absorption** directly and confirm. If the value exceeds its current capacity, the same confirmation includes the capacity increase first. Capacity-only edits remain available and do not heal. Absorption saves its remaining amount after damage; armor-bypassing damage still applies.

Use **Infinity Menu → AI Helpers** to create or manage up to six named AI player avatars. The first-helper button and status report make their presence visible. Choose Primitive, Regular, Ultimate Finals, Debug, CLI or API. Ultimate Finals shares targets, predicts pursuit, charges with a native netherite spear, briefly glides with an equipped elytra and switches to a mace for a falling smash. Normal server ticks acquire and attack eligible hostile mobs. Player targets need both exact approvals; no totem bypass is guaranteed.

If a loaded helper is too far away or in another game world, select it and choose **Bring here**. Its existing health, profile and edited stats stay intact; it resumes Follow and the squad's player-target orders and pending target approvals are cleared. Unloaded helpers need their area visited first. Ordinary Follow does not teleport or load distant chunks.

The host can connect the installed, signed-in Codex CLI in the stopped-world panel. **Ask Codex** and questions in all six profiles then receive actual Codex answers with limited game facts. No API key is needed for that provider; the host account's usage limits still apply. Questions are separate sessions, not this live Codex conversation, and cannot execute or approve changes. Proposed server actions, code changes and exact player targets retain the owner's approval plus a separate live Codex review. See [`server/AGENTS_GUIDE.md`](server/AGENTS_GUIDE.md).

## Source layout

To build the Java mod from source, install Java 25 and run:

```sh
cd java
./gradlew build
```

The complete release packager additionally needs the verified server dependencies, Fabric API binary, resource-pack generation, and successful integration reports described in [`docs/CROSSPLAY_SOURCE.md`](docs/CROSSPLAY_SOURCE.md). Downloading the tested server ZIP is the easiest way to host. This repository includes the Gradle wrapper needed for Java builds, but excludes bundled Minecraft server dependencies and generated server archives. It also excludes live worlds, account and admin settings, private keys, API keys, logs, and runtime downloads.

The crossplay build is a preview. Automated tests cover server behavior and bridge startup, but an authenticated Bedrock device play-test is still needed for every touch-control and visual interaction. See [`server/VALIDATION.md`](server/VALIDATION.md) for the exact limits. This project is independent and is not approved by or associated with Mojang, Microsoft, CurseForge, or GeyserMC.

**Infinity Menu → Armor & tools → inventory** grants weapons, tools, the Infinity set, both complete cosmetic armor sets and a backpack into empty slots, preserving owned items. Creative players receive these automatically. Full gear boxes remain available for blocks and ammo. Bedrock uses complete native wearable assets; Java with the resource pack keeps original artwork. Accept the updated pack.

This release passed **315 native GameTests**, **98 launcher tests**, Geyser mapping/UDP checks and two isolated restart cycles. Real Java/iPad appearance still needs a device check. The focused skin patch has no fresh external consultant review. See [validation details](server/VALIDATION.md).
